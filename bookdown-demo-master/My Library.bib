	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder ({ASD}) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. To enhance the understanding of the gut microbiota structure in {ASD} children at different ages as well as the relationship between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used the 16S {rRNA} sequencing to evaluate the gut microbial population in a cohort of 143 children aged 2–13 years old. We found that the α-diversity of {ASD} group showed no significant change with age, while the {TD} group showed increased α-diversity with age, which indicates that the compositional development of the gut microbiota in {ASD} varies at different ages in ways that are not consistent with {TD} group. Recent studies have shown that chronic constipation is one of the most commonly obvious gastrointestinal ({GI}) symptoms along with {ASD} core symptoms. To further investigate the potential interaction effects between {ASD} and {GI} symptoms, the 30 C-{ASD} and their aged-matched {TD} were picked out to perform metagenomics analysis. We observed that C-{ASD} group displayed decreased diversity, depletion of species of Sutterella, Prevotella, and Bacteroides as well as dysregulation of associated metabolism activities, which may involve in the pathogenesis of C-{ASD}. Consistent with metagenomic analysis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}) revealed some of the differential metabolites between C-{ASD} and {TD} group were involved in the metabolic network of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, histidine, and {GABA}. Furthermore, we found these differences in metabolites were associated with altered abundance of specific bacteria. The study suggested possible future modalities for {ASD} intervention through targeting the specific bacteria associated with neurotransmitter metabolism.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is characterised by deficits in the ability to socialise, communicate and use imagination, and displays of stereotypical behaviour. It is widely accepted that {ASD} involves a disorder in brain development. However, the real causes of the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with {ASD} are not clear. In this respect, it has been found that a majority of children with {ASD} display gastrointestinal symptoms, and an increased intestinal permeability. Moreover, large differences in microbiotic composition between {ASD} patients and controls have been reported. Therefore, nutrition-related factors have been hypothesised to play a causal role in the aetiology of {ASD} and its symptoms. Through a review of the literature, it was found that abnormalities in carbohydrate digestion and absorption could explain some of the gastrointestinal problems observed in a subset of {ASD} patients, although their role in the neurological and behavioural problems remains uncertain. In addition, the relationship between an improved gut health and a reduction of symptoms in some patients was evaluated. Recent trials involving gluten-free diets, casein-free diets, and pre- and probiotic, and multivitamin supplementation show contradictive but promising results. It can be concluded that nutrition and other environmental influences might trigger an unstable base of genetic predisposition, which may lead to the development of autism, at least in a subset of {ASD} patients. Clear directions for further research to improve diagnosis and treatment for the different subsets of the disorder are provided.},

	abstract = {Background: Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is often associated with increased intracranial pressure and can be the initial manifestation of hyponatremic encephalopathy. Marathon runners tend to develop conditions that lead to hyponatremia. In a recent prospective study, 18\% of 605 marathon runners developed hyponatremia; women with hyponatremia had lower plasma sodium levels and were more symptomatic than men (1). Hyponatremia in these patients resulted from substantial retention of ingested water (1). We recently reported that patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy can present with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (2). In the present report, we describe seven marathon runners who presented with hyponatremic encephalopathy and pulmonary edema.
Objective: To describe the development and treatment of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in marathon runners that was associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy. Case Findings Design: Case series. Setting: One university hospital and two community hospitals. Patients: Seven healthy marathon runners who had a history of nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug use. The runners collapsed after competing in a marathon and were hospitalized with pulmonary edema.
Measurements: Plasma sodium levels, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, cardiac enzyme levels, and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans of the brain.
Results: Patients had nausea, emesis, and obtundation. The mean (Ϯ{SD}) plasma sodium level was 121 Ϯ 3 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation was less than 70\%. Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were normal. Chest radiographs showed pulmonary edema with a normal heart. Creatine phosphokinase–{MB} bands, troponin levels, and pulmonary wedge pressure were not elevated. Scanning of the brain showed cerebral edema. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Treatment with intravenous {NaCl}, 514 mmol/L, increased plasma sodium levels by 10 mmol/L in 12 hours. Pulmonary and cerebral edema resolved as the sodium level increased. One patient had unsuspected hyponatremic encephalopathy and died of cardiopulmonary arrest caused by brainstem herniation. All six treated patients recovered and were well after 1 year of follow-up.
Conclusions: In healthy marathon runners, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can be associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy. The condition may be fatal if undiagnosed and can be successfully treated with hypertonic {NaCl}.},

In this paper, we review the features of the R package {survHE}, speciﬁcally designed to wrap several tools to perform survival analysis for economic evaluation. In particular, {survHE} embeds both a standard, frequentist analysis (through the R package ﬂexsurv) and a Bayesian approach, based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (via the R package rstan) or integrated nested Laplace approximation (with the R package {INLA}). Using this composite approach, we obtain maximum ﬂexibility and are able to pre-compile a wide range of parametric models, with a view of simplifying the modelers’ work and allowing them to move away from non-optimal work ﬂows, including spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel).},

Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model {MI}; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

	abstract = {Objective: Hyperhydration and exercise-associated hyponatremia ({EAH}) are critical issues during endurance events. We studied a cohort of marathon runners to examine {EAH}’s prevalence in a marathon with a short time limit and to investigate underlying mechanisms that may be responsible for its development. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: 2006 Zurich Marathon (cool and rainy weather, time limit of 5 hours). Participants: 167 marathon runners were recruited the month before the race. Main Outcome Measures: Body mass, plasma sodium, and osmolality were measured just before the start and immediately after the race. Fluid intake during the race was ascertained by a recall questionnaire.
Results: Five subjects (3 \%) developed asymptomatic {EAH}, and no symptomatic {EAH} was found. Body mass change during the race correlated similarly with postrace sodium levels (r = 20.72, P , 0.0001) and with sodium change during the race (r = 20.66, P , 0.0001). Postrace sodium levels correlated signiﬁcantly with sodium change during the race (r = 0.74, P , 0.0001). Fluid intake correlated signiﬁcantly (r = 20.43, P , 0.0001) with plasma sodium change between the start and ﬁnish of the race. Postrace sodium levels and postrace osmolality were signiﬁcantly correlated (r = 0.68, P , 0.0001).
Conclusion: In this study we observed a relatively low incidence of {EAH} in subjects running the marathon in around 2.5 to 5 hours and in a cool environment. Plasma sodium change during the race and postrace sodium levels correlated with body mass change. There was also a direct correlation between ﬂuid intake and plasma sodium change during the race.},

	abstract = {Cerebral edema due to exercise-associated hyponatremia and cardiac arrest due to atherosclerotic heart disease cause rare marathonrelated fatalities in young female and middle-aged male runners, respectively. Studies in asymptomatic middle-aged male runners during races identified inflammation due to skeletal muscle injury after glycogen depletion as the shared underlying cause. Nonosmotic secretion of arginine vasopressin as a neuroendocrine stress response to rhabdomyolysis mediates hyponatremia as a variant of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Fatal hyponatremic encephalopathy in young female runners was curtailed using emergent infusion of intravenous hypertonic (3\%) saline to reverse cerebral edema based on this paradigm, which treatment was arrived at through a consensus process within the medical community. An increasing frequency of cardiac arrest and sudden death has been identified in middle-aged male runners in two studies since the year 2000. Same-aged asymptomatic male physician-runners showed post-race elevations in interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, which biomarkers predict acute cardiac events in healthy persons. Hypercoagulability with in vivo platelet activation and release of cardiac troponin and {NT}-pro-B-natriuretic peptide were also observed post-race in these same subjects. High short-term risk for atherothrombosis during races as shown by stratification of biomarkers in asymptomatic males may render non-obstructive coronary atherosclerotic plaques vulnerable to rupture. Pre-race aspirin usage in this high-risk subgroup is prudent based on conclusive evidence for preventing first acute myocardial infarctions in same-aged healthy male physicians. Based on validated clinical paradigms, taking a low-dose aspirin before a marathon and drinking to thirst during the race may avert preventable deaths in susceptible runners.},

	abstract = {Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ({SIADH}) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, {SIADH}, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic {SIADH}. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.},

	abstract = {Taurine content is high ({mM}) in mammalian brain. By its major role as an osmolyte, taurine contributes to the cell volume control, which is particularly critical in the brain. Taurine participates in osmotic adjustments required to maintain the organization and size of intracellular compartments. It counteracts volume fluctuations in unbalanced transmembrane fluxes of ions and neurotransmitters, preserving the functional synaptic contacts. Taurine has a key role in the long-term adaptation to chronic hyponatremia as well as in other pathologies leading to brain edema. Together with other osmolytes, taurine corrects cell shrinkage, preventing mysfunction of organelles and apoptosis. Swelling corrective taurine efflux occurs through a leak pathway, likely formed by {LCRR}8 protein isoforms. Shrinkage-activated influx comes largely by the increased activity of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter. The brain taurine pool results from the equilibrium between (i) dietary intake and active transport into the cell, (ii) synthesis in the brain itself or import of that synthesized elsewhere, and (iii) leak and posterior excretion. The interplay between these elements preserves brain taurine homeostasis in physiological conditions and permits the proper adjustments upon deviations of normal in the internal/external environment.},

Significant negative correlations between Na and K were seen in these periods: 3.5 to 6; 8 to 18, 20 to 32 wk postpartum (p \&lt; 0.01 for each). The mean 24 h milk sodium concentrations (x̄Na) decreased between 3.5 and 18 wk postpartum (p \&lt; 0.005 by paired t test). Changes in mean potassium (x̄K) were not statistically significant. Diet apparently does not affect milk Na. Administration of a low Na diet: 10.8 ± .9 ({SD}) {mEq} Na/day and 60 to 100 {mEq} K/day for 2 days did not change x̄Na. But urinary Na decreased 7-fold as aldosterone increased 5-fold. No significant correlation was seen between 24 h Na excretion in urine and x̄Na in milk (n = 51). A significant positive correlation was seen between urinary K and x̄K in milk (r = 0.36), p \&lt; 0.001).},

	abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for {DNA} sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in {RNA}-Seq focused R packages such as {edgeR} and {DESeq}. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called {metagenomeSeq}. We find that {metagenomeSeq} performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

The purpose of this review is to analyze the basis of this assumption by examining the comparative studies between Asperger’s disorder ({AsD}) and autistic disorder ({AD}), and between pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise speciﬁed ({PDDNOS}) and {AD}. In all, 125 studies compared {AsD} with {AD}. Of these, 30 studies concluded that {AsD} and {AD} were similar conditions while 95 studies found quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Likewise, 37 studies compared {PDDNOS} with {AD}. Nine of these concluded that {PDDNOS} did not differ signiﬁcantly from {AD} while 28 reported quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Taken together, these ﬁndings do not support the conceptualization of {AD}, {AsD} and {PDDNOS} as a single category of {ASD}. Irrespective of the changes proposed by the {DSM}-5, future research and clinical practice will continue to ﬁnd ways to meaningfully subtype the {ASD}.},

	abstract = {Despite the availability of abundant literature on green tea, studies on the use of L-theanine (an amino acid found only in green tea) as a feed additive in poultry especially broiler are limited. So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet + 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet + 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet + 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic {DNA} was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal {RNA}. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine significantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P {\textless} 0.05). Results of this study revealed that {mRNA} expression of {TLRs} ({TLR}-2 and {TLR}-4) and cytokines ({TNF}-α, {IFN}-γ, and {IL}-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of {IL}-2 and {IFN}-γ in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P {\textless} 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.},

However, high-throughput sequencing of the full gene has only recently become a realistic prospect. Here, we use in silico and sequence-based experiments to critically re-evaluate the potential of the 16S gene to provide taxonomic resolution at species and strain level. We demonstrate that targeting of 16S variable regions with short-read sequencing platforms cannot achieve the taxonomic resolution afforded by sequencing the entire ({\textasciitilde}1500 bp) gene. We further demonstrate that full-length sequencing platforms are sufficiently accurate to resolve subtle nucleotide substitutions (but not insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation between 16S gene copies. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate treatment of full-length 16S intragenomic copy variants has the potential to provide taxonomic resolution of bacterial communities at species and strain level.},

The body sites with the greatest number of core {OTUs}, defined as {OTUs} shared amongst 95\% or more of the individuals, were the oral sites (saliva, tongue, cheek, gums, and throat) followed by the nose, stool, and skin, while the vaginal sites had the fewest number of {OTUs} shared across subjects. We found that commonalities between samples based on taxonomy could sometimes belie variability at the sub-genus {OTU} level. This was particularly apparent in the mouth where a given genus can be present in many different oral sites, but the sub-genus {OTUs} show very distinct site selection, and in the vaginal sites, which are consistently dominated by the Lactobacillus genus but have distinctly different sub-genus V1–V3 {OTU} populations across subjects. Different body sites show approximately a ten-fold difference in estimated microbial richness, with stool samples having the highest estimated richness, followed by the mouth, throat and gums, then by the skin, nasal and vaginal sites. Richness as measured by the V1–V3 primers was consistently higher than richness measured by V3–V5. We also show that when such a large cohort is analyzed at the genus level, most subjects fit the stool “enterotype” profile, but other subjects are intermediate, blurring the distinction between the enterotypes. When analyzed at the finer-scale, {OTU} level, there was little or no segregation into stool enterotypes, but in the vagina distinct biotypes were apparent. Finally, we note that even {OTUs} present in nearly every subject, or that dominate in some samples, showed orders of magnitude variation in relative abundance emphasizing the highly variable nature across individuals.},

The emerging field of metagenomics offers a new way of exploring the microbial world that will transform modern microbiology and lead to practical applications in medicine, agriculture, alternative energy, environmental remediation, and many others areas. Metagenomics allows researchers to look at the genomes of all of the microbes in an environment at once, providing a "meta" view of the whole microbial community and the complex interactions within it. It's a quantum leap beyond traditional research techniques that rely on studying-one at a time-the few microbes that can be grown in the laboratory. At the request of the National Science Foundation, five Institutes of the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy, the National Research Council organized a committee to address the current state of metagenomics and identify obstacles current researchers are facing in order to determine how to best support the field and encourage its success. The New Science of Metagenomics recommends the establishment of a "Global Metagenomics Initiative" comprising a small number of large-scale metagenomics projects as well as many medium- and small-scale projects to advance the technology and develop the standard practices needed to advance the field. The report also addresses database needs, methodological challenges, and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in supporting this new field.},

Much work remains to understand how this "instruction book for human biology" carries out its multitudes of functions. But the consequences for the practice of medicine are likely to be profound. Genetic prediction of individual risks of disease and responsiveness to drugs will reach the medical mainstream in the next decade or so. The development of designer drugs, based on a genomic approach to targeting molecular pathways that are disrupted in disease, will follow soon after. Potential misuses of genetic information, such as discrimination in obtaining health insurance and in the workplace, will need to be dealt with swiftly and effectively.

	abstract = {Recent studies of 16S {rRNA} sequences through next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the microbial community composition and structure. One common approach in using these data to explore the genetic diversity in a microbial community is to cluster the 16S {rRNA} sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units ({OTUs}) based on sequence similarities. The inferred {OTUs} can then be used to estimate species, diversity, composition, and richness. Although a number of methods have been developed and commonly used to cluster the sequences into {OTUs}, relatively little guidance is available on their relative performance and the choice of key parameters for each method. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten existing {OTU} inference methods. We found that the appropriate dissimilarity value for defining distinct {OTUs} is not only related with a specific method but also related with the sample complexity. For data sets with low complexity, all the algorithms need a higher dissimilarity threshold to define {OTUs}. Some methods, such as, {CROP} and {SLP}, are more robust to the specific choice of the threshold than other methods, especially for shorter reads. For high-complexity data sets, hierarchical cluster methods need a more strict dissimilarity threshold to define {OTUs} because the commonly used dissimilarity threshold of 3\% often leads to an under-estimation of the number of {OTUs}. In general, hierarchical clustering methods perform better at lower dissimilarity thresholds. Our results show that sequence abundance plays an important role in {OTU} inference. We conclude that care is needed to choose both a threshold for dissimilarity and abundance for {OTU} inference.},

Particularly, 16S {rRNA} gene sequences have been frequently used to profile the diversity of organisms in a sample. However, such studies are still taxed to determine both the number of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) and their relative abundance in a sample.Results: To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian clustering method termed Clustering 16S {rRNA} for {OTU} Prediction ({CROP}). {CROP} can find clusters based on the natural organization of data without setting a hard cut-off threshold (3\%/5\%) as required by hierarchical clustering methods. By applying our method to several datasets, we demonstrate that {CROP} is robust against sequencing errors and that it produces more accurate results than conventional hierarchical clustering methods.Availability and Implementation: Source code freely available at the following {URL}: http://code.google.com/p/crop-tingchenlab/, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux and {MS} Windows.Contact:tingchen@usc.{eduSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	doi = {10.3389/fmicb.2020.607325},
	abstract = {Background: The accuracy of microbial community detection in 16S {rRNA} marker-gene and metagenomic studies suffers from contamination and sequencing errors that lead to either falsely identifying microbial taxa that were not in the sample or misclassifying the taxa of {DNA} fragment reads. Removing contaminants and filtering rare features are two common approaches to deal with this problem. While contaminant detection methods use auxiliary sequencing process information to identify known contaminants, filtering methods remove taxa that are present in a small number of samples and have small counts in the samples where they are observed. The latter approach reduces the extreme sparsity of microbiome data and has been shown to correctly remove contaminant taxa in cultured “mock” datasets, where the true taxa compositions are known. Although filtering is frequently used, careful evaluation of its effect on the data analysis and scientific conclusions remains unreported. Here, we assess the effect of filtering on the alpha and beta diversity estimation as well as its impact on identifying taxa that discriminate between disease states.Results: The effect of filtering on microbiome data analysis is illustrated on four datasets: two mock quality control datasets where the same cultured samples with known microbial composition are processed at different labs and two disease study datasets. Results show that in microbiome quality control datasets, filtering reduces the magnitude of differences in alpha diversity and alleviates technical variability between labs while preserving the between samples similarity (beta diversity). In the disease study datasets, {DESeq}2 and linear discriminant analysis Effect Size ({LEfSe}) methods were used to identify taxa that are differentially abundant across groups of samples, and random forest models were used to rank features with the largest contribution toward disease classification. Results reveal that filtering retains significant taxa and preserves the model classification ability measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC}). The comparison between the filtering and the contaminant removal method shows that they have complementary effects and are advised to be used in conjunction.Conclusions: Filtering reduces the complexity of microbiome data while preserving their integrity in downstream analysis. This leads to mitigation of the classification methods' sensitivity and reduction of technical variability, allowing researchers to generate more reproducible and comparable results in microbiome data analysis.},

We performed a large autism stool metagenomics study (n = 247) based on participants from the Australian Autism Biobank and the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain project. We found negligible direct associations between {ASD} diagnosis and the gut microbiome. Instead, our data support a model whereby {ASD}-related restricted interests are associated with less-diverse diet, and in turn reduced microbial taxonomic diversity and looser stool consistency. In contrast to {ASD} diagnosis, our dataset was well powered to detect microbiome associations with traits such as age, dietary intake, and stool consistency. Overall, microbiome differences in {ASD} may reflect dietary preferences that relate to diagnostic features, and we caution against claims that the microbiome has a driving role in {ASD}.},

	abstract = {The microbiome regulates endocrine systems and influences many aspects of hormone signaling. Using examples from different animal taxa, we highlight the state of the science in microbiome research as it relates to endocrinology and endocrine disruption research. Using a comparative approach discussing fish, birds, and mammals, we demonstrate the bidirectional interaction between microbiota and hormone systems, presenting concepts that include (1) gastrointestinal microbiome regulation of the neuroendocrine feeding axis; (2) stress hormones and microbial communities; (3) the role of site-specific microbiota in animal reproduction; (4) microbiome effects on the neuroendocrine systems and behavior; and (5) novel mechanisms of endocrine disruption through the microbiome. This mini-review demonstrates that hormones can directly affect the richness and diversity of microbiota and conversely, microbiota can influence hormone production and mediate their functions in animals. In addition, microbiota can influence the action of a diverse range of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the central nervous system, which can lead to behavioral disruptions. As many animals have species-specific reproductive behaviors, it is important to understand how shifts in the microbiota relate to these complex interactions between sexes. This is especially important for captive animals on specialized diets, and there are significant implications for microbiome research in conservation and reproductive biology. For example, microbial metabolites may modify motility of gametes or modulate hormone-receptor interactions in reproductive tissues. Thus, efforts to incorporate metabolomics into the science of microbiome-endocrine relationships, both those produced by the host and those generated from microbial metabolism, are increasingly needed. These concepts have fostered an exciting emerging era in comparative endocrinology.},

	abstract = {Background The analysis of microbial communities through {DNA} sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast {UniFrac}, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.

Despite numerous such statements in publications, the literature does not provide a clear overview on the subject. In the present manuscript, we highlight recent work on the cultivation of bacteria from the intestine of mammals, review the literature and provide novel data pertaining to cultured fractions of mammalian gut microbiota. These data show that, despite marked inter-sample variations, 35 to 65\% of molecular species detected by sequencing have representative strains in culture.},

	abstract = {High-throughput post-genomic studies are now routinely and promisingly investigated in biological and biomedical research. The main statistical approach to select genes differentially expressed between two groups is to apply a t-test, which is subject of criticism in the literature. Numerous alternatives have been developed based on different and innovative variance modeling strategies. However, a critical issue is that selecting a different test usually leads to a different gene list. In this context and given the current tendency to apply the t-test, identifying the most efficient approach in practice remains crucial. To provide elements to answer, we conduct a comparison of eight tests representative of variance modeling strategies in gene expression data: Welch's t-test, {ANOVA} [1], Wilcoxon's test, {SAM} [2], {RVM} [3], limma [4], {VarMixt} [5] and {SMVar} [6]. Our comparison process relies on four steps (gene list analysis, simulations, spike-in data and re-sampling) to formulate comprehensive and robust conclusions about test performance, in terms of statistical power, false-positive rate, execution time and ease of use. Our results raise concerns about the ability of some methods to control the expected number of false positives at a desirable level. Besides, two tests (limma and {VarMixt}) show significant improvement compared to the t-test, in particular to deal with small sample sizes. In addition limma presents several practical advantages, so we advocate its application to analyze gene expression data.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is a severely neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs a child's ability to communicate and interact with others. Children with neurodevelopmental disorder, including {ASD}, are regularly affected by gastrointestinal problems and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. On the other hand, humans live in a co-evolutionary association with plenty of microorganisms that resident on the exposed and internal surfaces of our bodies. The microbiome, refers to the collection of microbes and their genetic material, confers a variety of physiologic benefits to the host in many key aspects of life as well as being responsible for some diseases. A large body of preclinical literature indicates that gut microbiome plays an important role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that communicates between the gut and central nervous system. Moreover, accumulating evidences suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the pathogenesis of {ASD}. The present review introduces the increasing evidence suggesting the reciprocal interaction network among microbiome, gut and brain. It also discusses the possible mechanisms by which gut microbiome influences the etiology of {ASD} via altering gut-brain axis. Most importantly, it highlights the new findings of targeting gut microbiome, including probiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplant, as novel and potential therapeutics for {ASD} diseases.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that affects one in 45 children in the United States, with a similarly striking prevalence in countries around the world. However, mechanisms underlying its etiology and manifestations remain poorly understood. Although {ASD} is diagnosed based on the presence and severity of impaired social communication and repetitive behavior, immune dysregulation and gastrointestinal issues are common comorbidities. The microbiome is an integral part of human physiology; recent studies show that changes in the gut microbiota can modulate gastrointestinal physiology, immune function, and even behavior. Links between particular bacteria from the indigenous gut microbiota and phenotypes relevant to {ASD} raise the important question of whether microbial dysbiosis plays a role in the development or presentation of {ASD} symptoms. Here we review reports of microbial dysbiosis in {ASD}. We further discuss potential effects of the microbiota on {ASD}-associated symptoms, drawing on signaling mechanisms for reciprocal interactions among the microbiota, immunity, gut function, and behavior. In addition, we discuss recent findings supporting a role for the microbiome as an interface between environmental and genetic risk factors that are associated with {ASD}. These studies highlight the integration of pathways across multiple body systems that together can impact brain and behavior and suggest that changes in the microbiome may contribute to symptoms of neurodevelopmental disease.},
